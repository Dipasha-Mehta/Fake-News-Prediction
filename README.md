# Fake-News-Prediction

# Overview
The Fake News Prediction project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. With the widespread dissemination of misinformation, this project provides a reliable approach to identifying deceptive news sources.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles, enabling supervised learning. Data preprocessing includes removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, followed by tokenization and lemmatization. The processed text is then vectorized using methods like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert it into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

# Methodology
Various machine learning models are implemented to classify the news articles, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. The performance of these models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance predictive accuracy.

# Technologies Used
This project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, with essential libraries such as Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing.

# Installation & Usage
To run the project, first, ensure Python 3.x and required dependencies are installed. Clone the repository using Git, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the provided script to execute the model. The notebook contains step-by-step code execution, making it easy to follow and understand.

# Results & Performance
The trained model demonstrates strong performance in identifying fake news articles. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score indicate the effectiveness of the approach. Visualizations and classification reports help analyze model performance, providing insights into areas for improvement.
